# Note-Taker

This is an app developed to be able to take notes.

I developed the backend to handle this data given by the user.

Using a db.json file to store the data for the user.

The server then feeds that information that is pulled out using the front end JS and it populates the page. The data is also saved in the db.json file for later use.
